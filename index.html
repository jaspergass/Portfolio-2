          <p>I am a 3rd year design student at the School of Interactive Art and Technology at SFU 
            with an intense curiosity and passion for experience and analysis. As humans, experience 
            is everything– it is our senses that allow us to find meaning in the world around us and 
            understanding within ourselves. Even the smallest interactions we have can have lasting and 
            meaningful impacts. As a designer, I hope to create beautiful interfaces and experiences that
             people can find pleasure in, down to the smallest details, because it’s the little things that count.</p>

          <p>I made this website over the course of 2 months. I made a portfolio in Fall 2022 but felt that
             it needed to be improved (to see that project, click here). My goal with this project was to 
             improve the visual style of my site and include an archive to view past works and my photography.</p>

          <p>I drew a lot of inspiration for this site from Locomotive https://locomotive.ca/en, a Montreal 
            based design agency that I admire a lot. I also knew I wanted to re-do a video project I did in high 
            school that used milk, food colouring, soap, and oil to create an abstract montage for my home page.</p>
          <p>I began by creating many mockups in figma, quickly iterating through different ideas for menu systems
            and content layouts to explore my options. I ultimately decided that many of my ideas were overly complex;
             I wanted something simple, refined, and easy to understand. Thats why I chose this very simple navigation
              system and structure for all my pages. To make my site stand out, the video and effect on the text on
               the home page and my cursor are much more visually complex to balance out the simplicity of the website’s
                structure. </p>

          <p>I spent a long time trying to get the site as responsive as possible. To catch any errors, 
            I had several friends test the website to get their feedback and find any flaws. Some key instances
             of responsiveness are my text sizes which grow and shrink using a calculation based on the viewport
              size and the navigation bar that condenses into a menu button at smaller resolutions.</p>
          <p>I also spent a long time getting my photo gallery on the archive page to work. I modified someone’s 
            code from codepen so that I could change out the collection of images being displayed to showcase my 
            different photography collections. This took several hours of troubleshooting to modify and make responsive.
             I am unfamiliar with the component it uses, called a vue gallery, but after spending some time to understand 
             the code I managed to make it do what I wanted. In the future, I would love to make my own from scratch to
              improve my coding skills and get the exact behaviour I want.</p>
