          <p>The first portfolio I made started as a <a href="../html/portfolio1.html">class project</a> in Fall 2022. Since then, 
            I have been consistently updating and modifying the site to meet my needs. The following p
            roject process details the initial creation of this website and some of the modifications I have made over time.

          <p>I drew a lot of inspiration for this site from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://locomotive.ca/en">Locomotive</a>; a Montreal 
            based design agency that I admire a lot. I also knew I wanted to re-do a video project I did in high 
            school that used milk, food colouring, soap, and oil to create an abstract montage for my home page.</p>
          <p>I began by creating many mockups in Figma, quickly iterating through different ideas for menu systems
            and content layouts to explore my options. I ultimately decided that many of my ideas were overly complex;
             I wanted something simple, refined, and easy to understand. Thats why I chose this very simple navigation
              system and structure for all my pages. To make my site stand out, the visual complexity of the video and
               the home page text effects balance out the simplicity of the website’s structure.  </p>
          
          <a class="glightbox" href="../img/Portfolio2/portfolioMockups.png"><img src="../img/Portfolio2/portfolioMockups.png" alt="A screenshot of my figma design iterations."></a>
          
          <p>In order to make my cursor have a unique shape and mixed blend mode effect through CSS, it needed to be 
            an actual object on the page instead of the normal cursor. To achieve this, I hid the real cursor and 
            created an object on the page that moves using javascript and applied the blend mode. </p>
          <p>The video component to my home page was key to the site’s character. While prototyping, I used a clip 
            of old footage from high school that I took on a camcorder. I didn’t want to use this footage for my site
             because the visual style from the camcorder is too rough for the clean and modern style I was aiming for.
              I filmed new footage on my XXXX camera. Below is what the site looked like using the placeholder footage,
               and what it looked like when I was editing the new clips in Adobe Premiere.</p>

          </div>
          
          <p>I also used Git to save my progress. I didn’t run into any issues in development that required reverting
             the project to previous versions, but it was still good practice to make sure that none of my work got lost
              and was easily traceable.</p>

          <p>One of the biggest updates I have made to the site since creating it was the reorganization of the homepage. 
            Originally, the site had the process documentation on this page. I eventually moved this content to its own
             page and added a project showcase to the home page. This allows people to easily see an overview of my work 
             on the most convenient page. The overview includes the title, date, and some key terms to understand each project at a glance.</p>

          <p>I spent a long time trying to get the site as responsive as possible. To catch any errors, 
            I had several friends test the website to get their feedback and find any flaws. Some key instances
             of responsiveness are my text sizes which grow and shrink using a calculation based on the viewport
              size and the navigation bar that condenses into a menu button at smaller resolutions.</p>
          <p>I also spent a long time getting my photo gallery on the archive page to work. I modified someone’s 
            code from CodePen, so that I could change out the collection of images being displayed to showcase my 
            different photography collections. This took several hours of troubleshooting to modify and make responsive.
             I am unfamiliar with the component it uses, called a vue gallery, but after spending some time to understand 
             the code I managed to make it do what I wanted. In the future, I would love to make my own from scratch to
              improve my coding skills and get the exact behaviour I want.</p>

          <p>After finishing this project, I feel very accomplished. I achieved what I set out to do and learned 
            a lot in the process. I have a much greater understanding of javascript for websites.
            This updated portfolio is a much better representation of me and my skills. Unfortunately, I am sure 
            that within a few months of developing my skills further at school I will feel like this site is outdated
             again. I hope that because this one is more robust than my first I can continue to update it as 
             I develop my skills.</p>
