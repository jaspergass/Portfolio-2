          <p>Summer of 2024 I worked as a Graphic and Web Designer for the DSBIA. I worked closely with a large team 
            of other students specializing in community engagement,  event planning, marketing, social media, and safety.
             As the only graphic design student this summer, I was responsible for creating designs for all of the BIA’s 
             events and material. I also worked on a team called Click on Surrey which works with local businesses directly
              to help them improve their online presence and marketing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section-right">

          <p>From the start, I was most excited about creating the annual BIA Restaurant and Medical Guides. 
            The guides detail all of the restaurant and medical businesses within the BIA’s area. I worked 
            closely with the content organizer to make sure all of the restaurants were still open and their 
            information was up to date. The design was something I refined over the course of the whole summer.</p>

          </div>

          <p>I also had the pleasure of creating the first edition of the medical guide, which we named the Care 
            Companion. My colleagues spent a lot of time finding all of the businesses and their information in 
            order to create this guide, which i am very grateful for. This particular project had some major technical
             difficulties which resulted in me re-creating the entire file in indesign in 3 hours to submit it for printing
              on my last day of work. Despite the stress, I was able to finish it on time and I am proud of the work I
               accomplished. </p>

          <p>In the end we completed both guide books by the end of the summer and printed several thousand copies
             to be delivered via unaddressed ad mail to local apartment complexes. </p>

          <p>One other guide that I helped design was a pamphlet about accessibility for all candidates meetings. 
            These meetings are for political candidates to present their platforms, answer questions, and engage with
             the community. Ensuring accessibility to these meetings is really important to ensure that everyone in the
              community has equal access to information and political participation. I am really happy to have had the 
              chance to make this valuable resource. </p>

        <div class="section-right">
          
          <p>The BIA hosts a few large events every year. Their biggest event is an outdoor movie
            night at Holland Park. I created large posters which we printed on vinyl, little handouts
            to give to people at our other events, and a newspaper campaign that was published in Surrey Now-Leader. </p>
         
          <div class="box-wrap">

          </div>

          <p>Another event we hosted was Surrey Fest. I created flyers that were put up in community spaces like the
             library and local businesses, large signs for the event schedule and sponsors, a newspaper ad, and large
              digital ads for screens in the mall. </p>

          </div>

          <p>One of the most unique things I created this summer was a stamp hunt booklet. We wanted to engage
             the community and support local businesses by having participants go to businesses and ask a few questions
              to receive stamps. A complete book would count for an entry to win a gift card. These booklets were printed
               on card stock to allow for a stable writing surface. This project was quite a challenge to conceptualize,
                organize with the businesses, and realize as a functional booklet, but was definitely one of my favourite
                 things I made.</p>

          <p>This summer, Click on Surrey successfully helped X businesses. I helped create graphics, c
            onduct branding surveys, and improve websites.</p>

          <p>For a ramen restaurant, I helped create loyalty cards, designs for little acrylic table signs, 
            and social media posts.</p>

          <p>One website I updated was for an Indian restaurant. The site was hosted on wordpress, so all of my 
            modifications were made using the website builder. Below you can see a before and after of their home page. 
            These small changes helped improve legibility and brand consistency.</p>

          </div>

          <p>I also created two new pages for the restaurant’s special services. I created these pages using assets
             from other pages to maintain consistency.</p>

          </div>

          <p>I also helped an accounting firm with a brand identity survey. The firm is thinking about changing 
            their name when the owner retires and is in need of a website update. This survey was intended to help 
            them understand what direction they should go in and provide some basic information for another graphic
             designer when they do decide to update their website. One interesting thing I found through this survey was 
             that a majority of employees preferred a cooler blue combination (Option 1) than the one they currently have (Option 2). I suggested 
             that they change to these cooler tones because it is consistent with industry standards and with the key brand
              attributes found in the 2nd question.</p>

          <p>My time working at the BIA was extremely rewarding. I gained a lot of self confidence from working independently
             on so many projects. I also strengthened my communication and teamwork skills through collaborating with such a 
             large team of other students. I am really grateful for the experience and hope to keep developing my skills with 
             this newfound confidence. </p>
