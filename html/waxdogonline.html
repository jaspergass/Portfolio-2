            <p>This was a personal project I completed over the course of 4 weeks. WAX DOG is a North Vancouver based musician who was 
              looking to rent out their studio space and needed a website to advertise their services. I was responsible 
              for the artistic direction, photography, and coding of the site. I worked closely with WAX DOG to make sure
               the design met their needs. The finished site can be found here: <a href="https://waxdog-online.github.io/"

            <p>To begin, I visited the studio for a photoshoot. I helped take photos of the various equipment in the studio using my Fujifilm X-Pro1. I later edited these photos in lightroom to improve their contrast and legibility. Below you can see an example of a picture before and after editing.</p>

            <p>Now that I had the images I wanted to use for the site, I began wireframing. One key thing here was that the client wanted a black website. This was new to me so I spent some time finding inspiration. The client also has a very strong visual sense of character which I wanted to include while maintaining simplicity. For this, I wanted to add a scrolling bar at the top to mimic a scrolling LED sign. I felt this was a simple element that added the fun character that this website needed.</p>
            <img src="../img/waxdog/slider.gif" alt="A gif of the scrolling slider at the top of the site.">
            <p>As always, I spent extra time to make sure the site was fully responsive. It is really important to me that whatever I create remains accessible to all users regardless of what device they choose to access the website from. Below you can see some examples of how the site's content will reshuffle as the screen size changes.</p>

        <div class="section-right">
          <p>Because the scope of this project was fairly small I did not run into many issues, but there were a few key challenges. One was working with a static github page. Ideally, I would have liked to have a email form on the website so that potential clients could send an email message directly from the page, but github pages unfortunately do not support this action. To compromise, I added a button that creates a new email draft directly.</p>
          <p>Another challenge was organizing all of the content on one page. I decided that having multiple pages for this project would overcomplicate the flow. Having all of the information on one page keeps the experience simple and easy to navigate. However, this also meant I had to be careful about how I organized the content to make sure it wasn't too long and annoying to scroll through. In the end, I managed to reduce the content and organize it such that the page is easy to view and understand.</p>

          <p>Though it was short, this was one of the most enjoyable projects I have done to date. Working closely with a client to realize their ideas is a very engaging and fun process. It is highly rewarding to also be able to complete a project like this completely on my own because I can be in control of everything and feel proud of the final product. In the future, I would love to continue doing small projects like this to hone my skills.</p>
