        <div class="section-right">
          <p>This was a team project organized through a club called Surge. I was the team leader as well as
             the only designer on the team. Working with 4 developers, our goal was to produce a functioning 
             mobile app using React Native. We decided to work on an app concept I previously created called 
             <a href="../html/arcanamini.html">Arcana Mini →</a>. In the end, we were unable to complete the app, 
            but I was able to finish a complete re-design of the app and a functional figma prototype. The link 
            to the finished prototype can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/f4AN3eDZowTdrkUukAXeG3/Serge-Project---Team-Blue-(Arcana-Mini)?page-id=1238%3A871&type=design&node-id=1238-2453&viewport=-4440%2C2148%2C0.87&t=J3UYqWAV7Rq7ANP5-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1238%3A2451">here →</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
            <p>Just like the previous Arcana Mini, this mobile app acts as a journal and guidebook companion for tarot 
              reading. Tarot reading is a spiritual practice that uses a physical deck of cards to gain insight into the past, present or future. 
              The app allows users to look up definitions of cards and journal their thoughts to document their tarot 
              journeys and promote reflection. The app requires that the user owns their own deck of tarot cards, 
              but otherwise is accessible to both novice and expert tarot readers.</p>
            <a class="glightbox" href="../img/arcana_mini_2/Scene-1x.jpg"><img src="../img/arcana_mini_2/Scene-1x.jpg" srcset="../img/arcana_mini_2/Scene-2x.png 2x" alt="Several screens of the mobile project."></a>

            <p>Originally, I wanted to use the same design as the previous app prototype and focus on the coding. After 
              recieving some critiques, I realized that I should take the opportunity to improve the design of the app. 
              This was a very long process for me because it was the first time I had ever designed something on my own of 
              this size. Below you can see two iterations of designs that I went though. The left side has a very unqiue and 
              boxy style that I was very drawn to, but ultimately it didn't suit the app's personality. The right side shows where
               I started to refine a more soft and modern look that would make the app much more approachable and calm. One of 
               the biggest things I learned through the critiques was that, because journaling can be very personal, it was 
               important for the app to feel safe and trustworthy through its design.</p>
            <div class="two-img-box">
              <a class="two-img glightbox" href="../img/arcana_mini_2/Style1.png"><img src="../img/arcana_mini_2/Style1.png" alt="The first iteration of the app's appearance."></a>
              <a class="two-img glightbox" href="../img/arcana_mini_2/Style2.png"><img src="../img/arcana_mini_2/Style2.png" alt="The second iteration of the app's appearance. "></a>
            </div>

            <p>Since I was re-designing the app, I also took the time to consider some new features. Two things I considered were 
             a section to rank your mood in each journal entry, and a way to manually enter the cards you pulled in each
               reading. This would allow us to show the user statistics of their mood and most frequent cards over time. These features
                could be very useful because it would reveal patterns in mood and themes in their tarot readings, which should 
                encourage reflection and insight. Below are some iterations of these features. In the end, I never fully polished 
                these features because my team decided it would be outside the scope of the project.</p>

            </div>

            <p>An important step to creating the app was understanding the flow and technical requirements. We chose to visualize 
              this using a site map created in FigJam. This clearly shows all the screens that the app would need and how they
               are linked. This also helped inform the structure of the final figma prototype.</p>

          <h4>Challenges</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
          <p>This project was unfortunately subject to many challenges. One of the biggest challenges was working with React
             Native. All of our developers were new to React Native and were learning it for this project alone. We chose 
             React Native because we wanted to launch the app for both android and IOS systems and because it would be a
              good learning opportunity. However, this ended up being too much for the developers to take on and was a 
              significant barrier to the progress of the app.</p>
          <p>Another key challenge was communication. I learned early on that there are very few team projects in the computer
             science program, so the developers had little to no experience doing team work. This meant that most of them had 
             a very hard time communicating and keeping up with the team, and I would have to step up to being the team leader 
             due to my experience and my involvement with the app concept. It also prevented them from understanding the scope 
             of the project. With more team experience, I knew from the beginning how much work was going to be involved with 
             a project of this size and I was willing to sacrifice my time working on it. The other members of the team struggled 
             to calculate how much time was needed and were quickly overwhelmed with the work. I think this could have been 
             avoided by choosing a more simple project, but at the same time I think it was still worth the experience to try 
             and make this project work.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
          <p>In the end, we were unable to create an app in React Native, but I did complete a full working prototype 
            in Figma. Despite the challenges, I learned a lot working on this design. I was working full time as a UI 
            designer over the fall semester and doing the design work for this project after hours, which meant I was 
            spending a lot of time on Figma. I was learning so many new techniques all the time and solidifying the 
            knowledge by practicing actively at work and through this project. After this project, my knowledge  
            of Figma has increased tenfold and I have a new sense of confidence which will allow me to keep creating and learning.</p>
