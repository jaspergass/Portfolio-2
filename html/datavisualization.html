          <p>This was a two person project completed over the course of about 5 weeks. Together, we created a series 
            of data visualizations to explore effects of social media on mental health. We created these visuals using 
            Vega-Lite in Observable. A full report can be found <a href="https://observablehq.com/@jasper2-ws/iat355_final_jaspergass_joshuachin" target="_blank">here →.</a> 
            In this report you will find detailed information on the process of making the visuals, our findings, 
            and be able to interact with the visuals in real time.

          <p>The following video summarizes the project and demonstrates the interactivity:</p>

            <h4>Process</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
          <p>We started by defining 6 questions that would guide our exploration and serve as jumping points for creating 
            our visualizations. For example: What is the relationship between the number of hours using social media and 
            poor mental health tendencies? After defining these questions, we set out on sketching potential visualizations.
             We did this mostly on paper, but I also tried using Tableau to quickly generate visualizations to see how 
             effective they were.</p>

          <p>We wanted to keep our visuals as simple as possible. Data can often seem overwhelming, 
            so we wanted to make the experience intuitive. One way we achieved this was through interactivity.</p>

          <p>We grouped visuals of similar kinds together with a toggle to switch between variables. The heat maps below are 
            one example. They show the relationship between respondent’s daily social media usage and their tendency to get 
            distracted by social media, sleeping issues, and ability to concentrate. The interactivity here allows us to 
            condense 3 visuals into one, effectively saving space while still allowing the user to see the relationships 
            between the visuals and analyze the trends.</p>
            
            <iframe width="100%" height="573" frameborder="0"
            src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@jasper2-ws/iat355_final_jaspergass_joshuachin@1444?cells=viewof+heatmapRadio%2CHoursOnSocialMediaHeatMap"></iframe>

          <p>Another visual that had interactive elements was this histogram showing the distribution of ages of survey 
            respondents for the first survey. A toggle was used again to filter between either respondents’ gender or 
            occupation. The majority of respondents were between the ages of 18 and 27, but there were a few odd entries
             up to age 91. Instead of getting rid of these outliers completely, we give the user the ability to filter 
             them out using this slider if they want to. Reducing the range of ages shown also makes it easier to compare
              to the age and gender histogram for the other survey. </p>

              src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@jasper2-ws/iat355_final_jaspergass_joshuachin?cells=Survey1AgeGenderDistribution%2Cviewof+ageRange%2Cviewof+barSize"></iframe>
              <a class="glightbox" href="../img/DataVisualization/Survey2AgeGender.png"><img src="../img/DataVisualization/Survey2AgeGender.png" alt="."></a>

          <p>One final way we implemented interactivity was through “brushing.” The scatterplot below shows respondent's
             tendency to compare themselves to others through social media (self esteem). After selecting a range of 
             responses on the left scatter plot the user can see their corresponding ages in the visual on the right. 
             This helps separate the data amongst different ages to identify whether one age range suffers more significantly 
             than the other. A scatterplot, like a heat map, allows us to see the relationship between two dimensions. 
             The use of colour here acts the same as a heat map as well, telling us how many cases are stacked on top of
              one another. We preferred a scatterplot in this case though because the age data is much more widespread. 
              This visual helped us notice that the majority of people who ranked 4 or 5 on the self esteem scale were 
              in their early twenties, which could make sense considering that the environmental factors of these university
               students may be impacting their social media usage and self esteem.</p>

               src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@jasper2-ws/iat355_final_jaspergass_joshuachin@1447?cells=SelfEsteemAndAgeScatter"></iframe>

          <p>One of the most shocking things we found in our exploration of the data was the dramatic difference in effects
             of social media on each gender. In the visuals below, you can see that women tend to be more at risk for 
             lower self esteem and addictive social media tendencies than men.</p>

          <p>During my co-op with Fraser Health Authority I learned a lot about designing good data visuals, but I didn’t
            learn how to actually work with data and create the visuals using code. Being able to implement the knowledge 
            I gained during my work semester to create my own designs from start to finish in this project was very 
            satisfying. I also really appreciated learning the technical rules around designing data formally to 
            solidify my knowledge. I definitely have a newfound appreciation for data as a whole after learning its
             complexities. There are so many ways to display the same information, but it takes a lot of thought and 
             care to pick the right way for specific use cases. I am positive that the skills I have developed for 
             designing data will prove useful for a long time.</p>
