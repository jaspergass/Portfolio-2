          <p>This was a two person project that was completed over the course of 3 weeks. Together, my teammate and I fine 
            tuned YOLOv8 to create a CV model that can detect and classify tomatoes as healthy and unhealthy. We added 
            some of our own images to learn how to label and process image data. We also wrote a full report about the 
            project which can be accessed <a target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmKguv4FR_cruWpieFum50gtvTktj9OO/view">here→</a>.

            <h4>What is TomatoScout?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">

          <p>TomatoScout is an AI assistant that detects healthy and unhealthy tomatoes for large-scale applications 
            such as restaurants, grocery stores. This is a supervised detection problem trained on labelled tomato 
            images. On a smaller scale, identifying these differences could be done one at a time and wouldn't benefit 
            from an AI assistant. However, for large quantities purchased by businesses, an AI model would be very 
            useful to make sure that their produce is fresh before it is used for a dish or put out to be sold. This 
            would be faster and potentially more accurate than human sorting with a properly trained model.</p>

          <h4>Dataset</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
          
          <p>We started with <a target=”_blank” rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://universe.roboflow.com/project-yolo/tomato-nixik ">this dataset→</a> found on a website called roboflow. The tomato categories are: healthy 
            (612 samples) and three types of unhealthy tomatoes: early blight (173 samples), late blight (233 samples), 
            and bacterial spot (272 samples). For our purpose, we just need to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy 
            and not the different kinds of unhealthy tomatoes, but it could still be beneficial for the model to be able
             to identify different problems as it may help farmers and stores identify potential outbreaks in their supply. </p>
          
          <p>Each team member also took 30 new photos and annotated them using makesense.ai. We both chose to take our own 
            pictures to have more control over what kinds of images we were adding. We wanted to get pictures of sliced
             tomatoes, tomatoes with various backgrounds, different coloured tomatoes, and tomatoes next to similar produce
             like apples and persimmons to get a wider variety of samples. </p>

          <h4>Bias & privacy issues</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
          <p>Because we have nearly three times as many images of healthy tomatoes in comparison to the other categories, 
            the model will be more biased toward them. This is notable, as we did find that healthy tomatoes held the 
            highest confidence when analyzing the results of our trained models. Most of these healthy tomatoes are also
             red, which could cause a bias with the colour of the tomatoes. To solve this, we could have found more 
             images of tomatoes from the other three categories, or removed some of the healthy tomato images to have 
             a dataset with more equal distribution for all labels.</p>

          <p>When discussing privacy, we do not see any glaring ethical issues with detecting different kinds
            of tomatoes. One potential issue could be malicious intent when detecting the unhealthy
            tomatoes as some may use that to intentionally target specific farms or distributors.

          <h4>Model Evaluation</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
          <p>We discussed the differences between 3 models. Model 1 was our baseline for comparison. It used default 
            values and was trained using only the images from the original dataset, excluding the images we took. 
            Its performance, as expected, was average. Model 2 added in our images. We wanted to isolate how the 
            addition of these images affected our baseline model. The addition of our data as a test set negatively 
            affected the model’s accuracy, as reflected in the confusion matrix below. It seemed to be more confused 
            about the differences between early and late blight, and had more difficulty distinguishing the background
             from early blight tomatoes particularly. In Model 3, we increased the batch size to 20. The batch size is 
             how many examples the model goes through with each iteration of training. Increasing the batch size to 20 
             produced the most evenly distributed model we could get.

          </div>

          <p>To better compare Model 2 and 3, we looked at a few metrics. The recall-confidence curve shows how the 
            recall metric, aka the true positive rate, changes as the confidence threshold varies. Below, you can see
             how recall remains higher and more stable for longer in Model 3 than Model 2.</p>

         <p>The F1 confidence curves shown below also demonstrate how Model 3 had a more stable
          F1 score as confidence increased.</p>

          <p>In the end we were able to successfully train an AI to detect healthy and unhealthy tomatoes. In 
            future iterations of this project we would love to add more food varieties to teach the system how to 
            differentiate between tomatoes and non-tomatoes. We would also definitely use a more simplified label 
            system with just “healthy” and “unhealthy” categories. The inclusion of different types of tomato diseases
             and at different stages was overcomplicated for our use case and had a negative impact on the model’s 
             performance. The differences were so nuanced that our human eyes couldn’t tell, so it’s no surprise that 
             the model struggled with it as well.</p>
