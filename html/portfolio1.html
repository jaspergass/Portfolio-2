            <h4>Introduction</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
            <p>This portfolio website started as a 3 week long project for a web development class I took fall 2022. As an 
                individual project, I was solely responsible. The major components of the site were the style guide, a 
                statement about myself and 2 projects. I continued to develop the website after this project.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="process">
        <div class="section-left">
            <h4>Process</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
            <p>I had a personal portfolio prior to this project that I adapted from. My previous website, through Wix, 
                was not responsive as seen in the screenshot below where the content gets cut off on the right side. 
                To see this original site, visit <a target="_blank" href="https://jaspergass.wixsite.com/jjgportfolio">https://jaspergass.wixsite.com/jjgportfolio</a></p>
            <img src="../img/portfolio1/previous_site.png">
            <p>When creating my style guide I wanted a style minimal enough to let my projects and site content stand out,
                 but also retain some character and uniqueness.</p>
            <img src="../img/portfolio1/styleguide.png">
            <p>I then made wireframes. The wireframe below shows the layout I chose for the site, and below 
                it are two alternative versions of the header I considered.</p>
            <img src="../img/portfolio1/wireframe3.png">
            <div class="box-wrap">
              <img class="two-img" src="../img/portfolio1/wireframe2.png" alt="An error prompt for deleting an account.">
              <img class="two-img" src="../img/portfolio1/wireframe1.png" alt="The share feature pop up menu.">
            </div>
            <p>I then started filling the site with content. I received feedback from my TA that my personal statement 
                and projects lacked direction, so I refined my goals to be more specific to UX/UI and web development 
                work. A good example of this shift is seen in my personal title which I changed from “experience artist 
                and interaction designer” to “interface and interaction designer.”</p>
            <p>The rest of the work fell in pace as I simply put the content in and worked on website flexibility. For 
                an inside look at the html structure of this page, turn off the lights!</p>
            <p>One of the most important changes I made while refining this site after the project was due was changing
                 my title font. It was essential to the branding I had created, but after getting a few people to test 
                 my site I got feedback that suggested it was not easy to read. I changed from House of Cards to Sheepman
                  to keep the style but increase legibility.</p>

            <p>The most challenging part of this project was refining what my ambitions were. I have a lot of interests 
                so I always find it challenging to narrow down and focus on passions. This project made me realize that 
                I needed more direction and helped me refine my ideas of what career paths I want to work towards. I am 
                excited about the path ahead of me and I hope to refine my skills with this newfound direction.</p>
